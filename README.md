Java ray tracer following The Ray Tracer Challenge by Jamis Buck

I like math but this one tested my patience for sure.  My computer also didn't appreciate me putting it to work like this either.  Could take it further but it takes a while for good looking images to render...the one below was rendered while I slept so who knows how long it took.  Definitely want to come back to this in the future but not bad for like 10 days of work.
